## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR-001: Multi-Agent Architecture Pattern

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-08-26  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team

#### Context
Need to create a medical AI system that can handle diverse medical queries requiring different types of expertise (imaging, research, data analysis, etc.).

#### Decision
Implement a multi-agent architecture using the Agno framework with specialized medical agents coordinated by a central HALO (HALO Agent Interface) team.

#### Rationale
- **Specialization**: Each agent can focus on specific medical domains
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new medical specialties as separate agents
- **Maintainability**: Isolated agent logic reduces complexity
- **Flexibility**: Agents can be combined dynamically based on query requirements

#### Consequences
- **Positive**: Clear separation of concerns, specialized expertise, extensible architecture
- **Negative**: Increased system complexity, inter-agent communication overhead
