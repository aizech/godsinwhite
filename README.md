# GodsinWhite

GodsinWhite is a specialized medical AI platform built on top of the HALO (Hierarchical Agent Learning Orchestrator) framework. It provides a powerful platform for creating, assembling, and orchestrating AI agents specifically designed for medical purposes. Through its modern Streamlit-based interface, GodsinWhite makes advanced medical AI capabilities accessible and useful for healthcare professionals and organizations.

> We believe that AI should be a tool for everyone, not just a luxury for the wealthy. Our mission is to fundamentally change how medical professionals work by providing them with powerful, accessible AI tools.
